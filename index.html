      <h1>Bold. Authentic. Fearless.</h1>
      <p>
        At FLY, we're redefining streetwear for the next generation. Bold, authentic, and inspired by the pulse of the city,
        our clothing is designed for youth who want to stand out, express themselves, and live fearless.
        From statement hoodies, FLY is more than a brand — it's a movement.
